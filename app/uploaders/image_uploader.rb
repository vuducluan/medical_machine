  # Choose what kind of storage to use for this uploader:
  storage :file
  # storage :fog

  # This is a sensible default for uploaders that are meant to be mounted:

  # Provide a default URL as a default if there hasn't been a file uploaded:

    # ActionController::Base.helpers.asset_path("fallback/default.png")

  # process scale: [200, 300]
  #
  # def scale(width, height)
  #   # do something
  # end

  # Create different versions of your uploaded files:
  version :blog_thumb, if: :is_blog_img? do
    process resize_to_fit: [290, 230]
  end

  version :product_thumb, if: :is_product_img? do

  # For images you might use something like this:
  # def extension_whitelist
  #   %w(jpg jpeg gif png)
  # end

  # Override the filename of the uploaded files:
  # Avoid using model.id or version_name here, see uploader/store.rb for details.
  # def filename
  #   "something.jpg" if original_filename
